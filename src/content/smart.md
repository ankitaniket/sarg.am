There is only few criterias that one need to be good at to be called "SMART" in society. From our early childhood people start to judge us based upon various things like the way we speak, habits we cultivate and mainly studies.

Problem starts when a child does something good for one day. Everyone starts praising him; teachers tell other students to be like him, relatives tell their children to be like him. He get dopamine kick thinking if I act being smart everyone seem to like me. This becomes like a cycle that continuous for very long time even the entire life.

There is saying called `the rich get richer while the poor stay poor`. I think that is true for person also. When student gets good grades everyone start appreciating him and he thinks I must do this next time or else I won't get that feeling.

This cycle makes too much pressure. The "smart kid" develops fear of failure that can be paralyzing him. One bad grade becomes not just learning opportunity but identity crisis. "If I'm not smart, then who I am?" Meanwhile, those who are not labeled as "smart" they internalize different message: "No matter how hard I try, I will never be like them."

Our society definition of intelligence is too narrow. We give priority to mathematical reasoning and verbal fluency while ignoring equally valuable forms of intelligence: emotional awareness, artistic creativity, mechanical skills, or interpersonal relations.

Even more troubling is how this system affects real learning. The "smart" students become strategic grade-hunters, optimizing for recognition rather than understanding. They avoid taking intellectual risks and stick to what they already know they're good at.

### What I think?

If the world thinks in this way it's foolish to change the way it works. Just go with the flow and try to act smart. You will be sucessful one day for sure. `Fake it until you make it`
