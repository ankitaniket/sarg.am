title: Where do I see myself in future?

I want to live a peaceful life completely isolated from any of corporate drama while doing something of my own on the side.

I never want to run towards money but again never want to be in a position where I can't afford a thing which may bring dramatic change in life.

One of my ambitions is to start a computer science oriented college/campus/research lab where students are driven by infinite sum games. This is the most important thing I want to achieve in my life. Have the most inspiring teachers/leaders stop by.

I think and believe curiosity is the only thing that will drive us in future as everything will try to be more automated with little human interaction. Also, people who are really good at what they do will be valued a lot like we are seeing now so I need to improve a lot and stop coping.

I have had enough experience with all the feeling of working in a startup and working in a team and I believe I'd love to play most of the things solo. I need to lock in seriously and work else I will be like no one. I did it once when I was in high school now I need to do it now. I have what it takes to be extraordinary and I will prove the world I am.

I know it's hard, really hard. 99% I will fail but there's a slight 1% which is a reason for me to keep going. I have seen people achieve something that was considered impossible and those who think impossible itself says "I am possible" are the ones to do it.

This is a rant. I know people will make fun of it, still I will put it online and one day I will reflect back upon it since it's the day Sargam chose to live the life he wanted and started to put in real efforts.
