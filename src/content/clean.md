title: Clean code is the waste of your time

Coding is an interesting field. You learn so many concepts and still get that aha moment regularly. As you go on you tend to learn more useful syntax, patterns, apis and then design principles that will make your life so much easier.

But there's a small principle that I usually keep in my mind when trying to learn new thing. To not optimize or write the code in a clean way or most people say the best way. It is said that "Multiple iterations are usually better than one perfection". I believe in that too. While you could create a magical clean code fully optimized todo app in the best way possible. You could have create 3 more scrappy but good enough projects too. The later one will definitely help you understand and make you more comfortable in coding at least.

One small task that you can do is to write some code which might not be clear at first but add a small line of comment on why is it responsible? Altough, it's not great to have a lot of comments but generally it helps to create a sense around why what that code written.

I am speaking about clean code since I wasted maybe 2-3 years of my life trying to write the most optimized solution that I could think of in that time. While not spending time in creating actual working product or something that would make my living. I would used to think over a piece of code erase it since I think I had found a better one and so on. While I look at those mistakes of my from my current stand it looks so obvious that I was still writing bad code at that moment.

So, that's it write some quick and dirty code to

Make it work!

Make it better!

Then optimize!

Cheers! See you next time!
