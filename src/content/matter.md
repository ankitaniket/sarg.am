### Note to self

I can never be young and energetic again in life. Everday is intevitable path towards death. As Steve Jobs said, "Death is the destination we all share". There should be something from me towards the universe that is unique and adds some value for people. If I am unable to do so I am not much of a hero for my younger self.

In life (mostly), there are only a few things that actually matter. Family, a motivation to continue life, an income source to fund the prior. Even better if we can combine the second and third. We all are worried about what will people say if I do this and begin to praise a boy who did remarkable in his 20s.

```
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.```
The above verse is from the poem **The road not taken** by *Robert Frost*. I tend to take this very seriously, most of the time in life, there are two paths that anyone can take. One which seems like really cushy, comfortable and bright and other one being unknown, scary, filled with weeds where you clearly don't know will that work or not in the long run. While going in for that seemingly optimistic road will lead you somewhere safe there's not much excitement there. 

Over the years, I have taken a few decisions that were the road not taken and also got away with easier path. But there's one thing that I always believe in, most of the time the road not taken was always more fruitful and felt more exciting.

My goal is to become someone who just knows about computers and eventually focus on where I can improve in the world. There are many problems that have my eyes but at the moment I can't do anything about those. I definitely plan onto getting those off my list as life progresses.

Thank you for reading my thoughts. If you want to give any feedback to this blog email me at `hi@sarg.am`
