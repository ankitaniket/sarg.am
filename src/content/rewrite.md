title: Rewriting my life

I love to code. There are two particular things I really love when I am coding: creating from scratch and rewriting something. I believe same thing follow for our everyday life as well. 

Rewriting life means changing yourself on a fundamenal level. The way you think, behave and the habits cultivated over time. This requires a huge amount of dedication and patience. I had this on my mind for quite sometime and here I am trying to execute it.

So, what's the fuss all about?

I have a plan. Not something that everyone creates but doesn't endup following. But something I will definitely follow and keep up with.

Over last couple of years, I have thought sleep was for the weak. A "productive" and "hardworking" person should work through the nights to finishup their tasks and guess what they have the entire day on their hand. But now I've realized that's not the case in particular.

When someone wakes up entire night and goes to sleep around 3-6am. The next day is completly hard to handle. Lack of focus, yawning, nothing productive and a lot of other issues keep on following. Also, half the other day already ends and you never see the morning sunshine developing chances for fatal diseases.

So, I have laid a simple plan for myself:

- Wake up at around 6-7am.
- Do some sort of activity be it a walk, lifting weights, gym and suggestions welcomed.
- Get in the coding vibes by 8am.
- Write a monolouge about something or the day
- Think about use cases, reusuability and write maintainable code
- Read about something interesting
- Maybe write reviews on what I learnt
- Develop taste in things
- Think about a hard problem

All this is pretty hard for be if I'd be honest. Doing all this at the same time is quite difficult. But I am ready for the great rewrite of my own life.

Thank you for reading my thoughts. If you liked anything or want to ask questions feel free to email me at `hi@sarg.am` would love to hear your thoughts.
