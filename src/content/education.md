For most people, education represents the golden ticket to a better life. We often hear inspiring stories of an auto driver's son getting into a prestigious engineering college, painting a picture of endless possibilities. But only those who walk this path truly understand the reality behind these narratives.

In today's world, education stands as the thin line between privilege and struggle. While I've always been a strong believer in learning and excelled academically in the past, my perspective has shifted. The current education system feels more like a means to an end - a degree rather than a journey of discovery. I find myself questioning the value of memorizing outdated syllabi when I could be pursuing knowledge that truly ignites my curiosity and solves real-world problems.

As an engineering student in India, I grapple with these questions daily: Why am I studying this? How will these concepts serve me in the future? Beyond the title of "engineer," what practical value does this education truly offer? The disconnect between classroom theory and real-world application grows wider each day, leaving me to wonder if we're being prepared for the challenges of tomorrow or simply following an outdated script.
