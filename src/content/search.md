I have been a really curious individual throughout my life. I have been questioning why something happens and why did nature choose that particular way for solving that problem in certain way. Example: Hexagons are considered the strongest shape and many natural things are made up of it take bee hibe for an example.

Now, I am wondering, why did nature create humans? What is our purpose in life? Is it just to make a living out of a day job and just earn enough till our last breathe? Why do we love, care and have empathy towards others? What is the thing that bonds two strange hearts? Why do we have kids? To continue this cycle? To just keep on doing what we have been doing for ages?

All these are questions, many have thought, pondered and spent their entire lives on.

For me one such question is **computers**.

The way how different computer scientists have been figuring out a way to make the computation more efficient, secure and scalable is insane when you think about it. Currently the entire world is dependent on computers. From trade in the Jane Street to the small electric toothbrust we use in a regular basis. Everything is a computer.

I will always question. How such an awesome tool was created. How did we think about microprocessor, RAM and millions of other small details together. Who introduced the concept of shell? Who thought about programming?

My question here is if computers are already so optimized that we are almost reaching peak of computation. We are not innovating anything new but just improving slightly every year on the previous model. What is the next big thing that will bring the change? Is is something like whoop band or meta glasses or something totally different? And realistically how can I be part of it?

I have dreamt of being a part of a big thing and that is an itch that I have within me. I promise that I will make this happen and put a small dent in the universe. Until then I will still be asking questions, staying curious, helping others and in search for answers in life.
