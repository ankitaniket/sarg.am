While I was learning about neural networks which I thought were really complicated found that brain is a super computer with about 140 million neurons and with tens of billions of connections between them. Things which we feel are trivial like recognization of digits, thinking, reacting towards a stimulant, having feelings, etc are nothing but incredible operation that our body is able to perform on merely food, water and sleep.

This feels like an interesting topic which I am a bit eager to study nowadays.

I will keep this blog updated with my learnings
