title: Trying to write

I have been a awful person when it comes to write anything. From my early days at school where I absolutely hated writing at all. For an instance, I was told to write from A-Z and I was trying till another day but could not write it at all.

Another reason why I chose to study CS was mainly because we didn't have to wrtie a lot of things on paper.  

I am trying to experiment myself which I initially really heistated to do. Few of them being avoiding strangers, trying to speak my thoughts, texting girls, .... It goes on lol. Among them trying to write something that I can look up in future is definitely on top.

There are a lot of instances where a person can just merely do any effort and get unexpected outcomes. I think and heard from many sources (trust me bro) that doing a small effort of writing down your own thoughts can make so much difference.

Wait,... But what do I talk about next? I don't have any toughts, huh?

Maybe I can talk a few lines about people who inspired me at various levels. Or maybe I can try to express how I think. Arghhh, I don't know honestly.

So, I want this blog to be a little experiment that I will try to keep on investing my time upon. Hope someday, me trying to jot things down will actually might make a difference :D
