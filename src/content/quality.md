Quality is one of the rarest thing to search for in this modern world. While there are multiple tools which help us to move really fast while building a decent and usuable product or idea. There are almost none which focus on the quality of the acual idea/product.

Karri Saarinen, founder of Linear, says finding quality is hard since there are not a lot of people who have a great taste. It is not something you develop instantly but rather as you progress in life. Also, people tend to take quality for granted.

Question arrises how to implement quality in something?
The simple answer is with all the AI and modern day tech. It's not hard to build a great product with a small set of people who know thier craft in a small time frame and keep on iterating to make it better and better. A great product doesn't come from 10,000 hours of work, it comes from 10,000 iterations on the same thing. 

Similary in life as well, inorder to live a quality life. One must try a lot of things. It never means that if something worked great for soemone will always mean that it will work great for the other person too. You can mimik or copy the person's personality but you will still look like a copycat. I believe in trying 10 different things that at the end seeing what works for you. There is no just one right answer in life since we are born naieve and will die the same so it's our job to find what will be meaniful in life and what will improve the quality of ours. 

I have a dream to build a great product which has an awesome quality. Why quality you may ask?
With quality, people love your product, spread about it, others are willing to try it since they have heard about it and it makes easier to sell it to people because it's a nice demo which just tend to work. 

As my prior blog, I am in search of an interesting problem space where I can double down and explore about quality. The day I find that problem is the day I will start working my ass off to do that thing with my 100% willingness and willpower. But till then I will keep on exploring about concepts and other people thoughts regarding the similar vision about various things in life. 

This blog was highly inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/pCil7YNhNCU) where Karri talks about quality. I can resonate about everything he talks about and will try to implement the points in my real life.
