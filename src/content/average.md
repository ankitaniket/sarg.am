In software engineering, many people are just worried just about their next job, next paycheck, next job switch and so on. Merely only a handful try to construct enough skills to make themselves so good that no companies will leave them behind.

Let's say you live in a super smart place. Yet there will be people who are comparatively more smarter or less smarter as compared to others. While some kid from a very compeitive school might be just `average` for there but might be super smart for some other place.

### What point do I want to make here?

It's pretty easy to be ahead of most of the people. Being amongst the top ones is really hard but being better than at least 50% is quite easy. Think of it in another way, many people who are below average don't even know that they are bad infact they tend to think they are the ones who have the most knowledge and everyone else is just lucky.

### What I think?

Honestly, I should not comment on anyone or anything but I don't have much experience developing real software but I still tend to understand a lot of concepts that other people don't

Do I mean to say I am very smart? **NO**

I just mean to say what makes a person good developer is having that inner itch regarding why I don't know everything regarding a thing that mankind made just 40yrs ago.
